If you want to create a script to setup OpenWRT using all current settings on the device.

#!/bin/sh
# Create OpenWRT setup script
script="/tmp/uci_setup_script.sh"
echo "#!/bin/sh" > "$script"
echo "uci -q batch << EOI" >> "$script"
for section in $(uci show | awk -F. '{print $1}' | sort -u); do
uci show "$section" | awk -F. '{print "set "$0}' >> "$script"
echo "commit $section" >> "$script"
done
echo "EOI" >> "$script"
chmod 755 "$script"

If you are using image builder for custom firmware, then create a file for the files/etc/uci-defaults folder in the image builder directory.

#!/bin/sh
# Create OpenWRT uci-defaults file for image builder
# copy generated file to 'files/etc/uci-defaults/' folder in your image builder directory
script="/tmp/99-custom"
echo "#!/bin/sh" > "$script"
echo "uci -q batch << EOI" >> "$script"
for section in $(uci show | awk -F. '{print $1}' | sort -u); do
uci show "$section" | awk -F. '{print "set "$0}' >> "$script"
echo "commit $section" >> "$script"
echo "EOI" >> "$script"
chmod 755 "$script"
done
